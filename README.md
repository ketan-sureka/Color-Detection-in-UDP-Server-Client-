# Color-Detection-in-UDP-Server-Client-
This is a UDP based Server-Client program in which the client sends a name (can send the complete path if image is not in the same directory) of an image file and server opens it in a new window. Then you can double click anywhere on the popped-up image to see its RGB values displayed on left top of the image window. Hit 'Esc' key to close the image window. These values are extracted from the database named "colors.csv". The server also stores all the displayed values with file names as log in a text file titled "logs.txt". When the client sends "exit" both the sockets are closed.
